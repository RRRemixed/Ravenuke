This is the fix for the User Group module, as it just wasnt included !

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

to install:

Upload the http files (not the folder, but the folders inside the http folder) 

yoursite/modules
yoursite/blocks

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now go to admin.php modules and acvitate the module User Groups

then turn on the block Points through your admin.php Blocks area

you should now see the block working and the two links at the bottom
take you to the now in place module !!

to edit the points and groups system goto http://yoursite.com/admin.php?op=Groups
